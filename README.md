# Flight-Reservation-System
This Java console-based project simulates a simple Flight Reservation System that allows users to book, cancel, and modify flight reservations. It is designed as a beginner-to-intermediate level project demonstrating core object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and data structures (using LinkedList).
